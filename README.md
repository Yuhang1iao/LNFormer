The overall architecture of our methods.

## Usage

Our work was implemented based on paddle

- The code is tested on python3.7 and paddle 2.4.0
- The code is modified from paddleseg https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/PaddleSeg

## Notice

The code for the project is being put together and will be released shortly.
